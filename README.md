# SemaphoreProject

This is a **C# semaphore demonstration project** built with .NET and Visual Studio.

## 📌 Project Overview

The purpose of this project is to **demonstrate the use of semaphores** in concurrent programming.  
Semaphore objects are used to control access to shared resources in multithreaded applications — ensuring that only a limited number of threads can access a resource at the same time.

This project was created for **learning and practice** of:
- Thread synchronization
- Semaphore usage in C#
- Multithreaded application design

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- **Semaphore** — limits the number of threads that can enter a critical section concurrently.
- **Multithreading** — run several tasks in parallel.
- **Synchronization** — preventing thread conflicts and race conditions.

## 🛠 Technologies

- **Language:** C#
- **Platform:** .NET (.NET Framework / .NET Core / .NET 6+)
- **IDE:** Visual Studio

> The solution file `SemaphoreProject.sln` is included and ready to open in Visual Studio. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}

## 🚀 How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
